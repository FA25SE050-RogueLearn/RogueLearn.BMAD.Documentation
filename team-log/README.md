# Team Progress Log â€” Guide

This folder hosts the shared Team Progress Log. The team now uses a per-day file approach to improve visibility and organization.

## New Daily Workflow
1. Create a new daily file by copying `template.md` to `team-log/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2025-10-13.md`).
2. Update the date in the file title.
3. Add one table row per team member for that day.
4. Keep bullets short (use `<br>` to separate multiple bullets in a cell).
5. If there are no blockers, write `None`.

## File Naming Convention
- Use ISO format: `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2025-10-13.md`).
- Store all daily files in this `team-log/` folder.

## Daily File Structure (table)
Each daily file contains the following table:

| Date | Name | Yesterday (What I accomplished) | Today/Tomorrow (What I'm working on) | Blockers (What's in my way) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-10-13 | Sample Member | - Set up documentation structure<br>- Drafted Team Progress Log template | - Share template with the team<br>- Integrate log into daily standup routine | None |

## Tips
- Prefer action-oriented bullets and include issue/ticket references when helpful.
- If a blocker persists, carry it forward and tag the person who can assist.
