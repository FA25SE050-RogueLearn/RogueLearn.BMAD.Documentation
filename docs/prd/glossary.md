# RogueLearn Glossary

This document defines RPG-specific terminologies and gamification concepts used throughout the RogueLearn platform documentation and user interface.

## Core RPG Concepts

### **Arsenal**
A player's personal knowledge repository containing all their notes, documents, and learning materials. Functions as the player's "inventory" where they store and organize their accumulated knowledge and resources.

### **Character Creation**
The onboarding process where new users define their academic identity by selecting:
- **Route (Curriculum)**: Academic curriculum that serves as the foundational quest line (e.g., Software Engineering curriculum, Computer Science program)
- **Class (Career Specialization)**: Career-focused specialization from roadmap.sh that complements the curriculum (e.g., Full-Stack Developer, DevOps Engineer)
- **Skill-based Roadmap**: Integrated learning path combining curriculum requirements with career specialization

### **Experience Points (XP)**
Points awarded for completing learning activities, quests, and achievements. XP accumulates to increase the user's level and unlock new features or content.

### **Guild**
A learning community led by a Verified Lecturer where students can:
- Access curated learning materials
- Participate in group activities
- Receive guidance and mentorship
- Collaborate with peers in the same field

### **Guild Master**
A Verified Lecturer who creates and manages a guild, providing:
- Educational content and resources
- Learning guidance and mentorship
- Community management and moderation

### **Level**
A numeric representation of a user's overall progress and experience on the platform. Levels increase as users accumulate XP through learning activities.

The academic curriculum selected by the player that serves as the foundational quest line structure. The Route defines the primary learning path based on university program requirements, course sequences, and academic milestones.

### **Class (Career Specialization)**
A career-focused specialization from roadmap.sh that complements the player's curriculum. The Class provides supplementary quests and content to bridge gaps between academic learning and industry requirements.

### **Gap Analysis**
An AI-driven process that compares the player's selected curriculum (Route) with their chosen career specialization (Class) to identify missing industry-standard skills, technologies, and competencies not covered in academic coursework.

### **Curriculum-First Quest Generation**
The primary quest generation methodology where the academic curriculum forms the main quest line structure, with supplementary quests from roadmap.sh integration filling identified gaps between academic and industry requirements.
