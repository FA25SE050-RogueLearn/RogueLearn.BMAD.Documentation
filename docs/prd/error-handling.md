# Error Handling and Recovery

This document outlines the strategy for handling errors and ensuring system recovery for the RogueLearn platform.

## Guiding Principles

*   **User Experience**: Error messages should be user-friendly, clear, and provide actionable guidance whenever possible. Avoid showing technical jargon or stack traces to end-users.
*   **System Stability**: The system should fail gracefully and recover automatically from transient errors. Critical failures should trigger alerts for the development team.
*   **Logging**: All errors, both client-side and server-side, must be logged with sufficient context to aid in debugging.

## Error Handling Strategy

### Client-Side Errors

*   **Form Validation**: Input fields will have real-time validation to prevent common errors before form submission.
*   **Network Errors**: The application will handle API request failures (e.g., timeouts, no connectivity) gracefully, informing the user of the issue and allowing them to retry the action.
*   **Unexpected Errors**: A global error boundary will be implemented in the Next.js application to catch any unhandled exceptions and display a generic, friendly error page.

### Server-Side Errors

*   **API Validation**: All incoming API requests will be validated against a schema. Invalid requests will return a `400 Bad Request` response with a clear error message.
*   **Authentication & Authorization**: Unauthorized or forbidden requests will return `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` status codes respectively.
*   **Business Logic Errors**: Errors resulting from failed business logic (e.g., trying to add a user to a full party) will be handled gracefully and return appropriate `4xx` status codes with descriptive error messages.
*   **Internal Server Errors**: Any unhandled exceptions on the server will result in a `500 Internal Server Error`. These errors will be logged with high priority and trigger alerts.

## Recovery

*   **Automatic Retries**: For transient network errors or idempotent operations, the system may implement an automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff.
*   **Database Transactions**: Critical operations that involve multiple database writes will be wrapped in transactions to ensure data consistency. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire operation will be rolled back.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting**: The monitoring system will be configured to send alerts to the development team for high-severity errors (e.g., a spike in 500 errors, database connection failures) to enable a quick response.
