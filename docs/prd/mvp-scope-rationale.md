# Rationale for MVP Scope Decisions

This document provides the rationale behind the features included in and excluded from the RogueLearn MVP.

## Core Loop Focus

The primary goal of the MVP is to validate the core user loop: **Upload Syllabus -> Generate Quest Line -> Complete Quests -> Learn**. Therefore, the features selected for the MVP are those that are absolutely essential to support this loop.

## Included Features

*   **User Onboarding & Document Upload**: Essential for getting users and their data into the system.
*   **AI-Powered Quest Generation**: The core value proposition of the platform.
*   **Character Sheet & Skill Tree**: Provides the gamified progress tracking that is central to the user experience.
*   **Basic Note-Taking ("Arsenal")**: A simple version is needed to support the learning process.
*   **Browser Extension for Data Extraction**: This is a key feature for reducing user friction and making the platform easy to use.
*   **Party System**: Included to test the social learning hypothesis, which is a key differentiator.

## Excluded Features (Post-MVP)

*   **Educator & Admin Toolkit (Phase 3)**: While important for long-term success, this is not essential for validating the core student experience.
*   **Advanced Social Features (Phase 4)**: Features like Guild-vs-Guild competitions are extensions of the core social loop and can be added later.
*   **Marketplace & Economy (Phase 5)**: This is a complex feature set that is not required to validate the primary learning and gamification hypotheses.
*   **Advanced AI Features**: Features like proactive 'spell' suggestions and predictive analytics are enhancements that can be built on top of the core AI engine once it is validated.
