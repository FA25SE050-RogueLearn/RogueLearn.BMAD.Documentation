# Rationale for MVP Scope Decisions

This document provides the rationale behind the features included in and excluded from the RogueLearn MVP.

## Core Loop Focus

The primary goal of the MVP is to validate the core user loop: **Upload Syllabus -> Generate Quest Line -> Complete Quests -> Learn**. Therefore, the features selected for the MVP are those that are absolutely essential to support this loop.

## Included Features

*   **User Onboarding & Document Upload**: Essential for getting users and their data into the system.
*   **AI-Powered Quest Generation**: The core value proposition of the platform.
*   **Character Sheet & Skill Tree**: Provides the gamified progress tracking that is central to the user experience.
*   **Basic Note-Taking ("Arsenal")**: A simple version is needed to support the learning process.
*   **Browser Extension for Data Extraction**: This is a key feature for reducing user friction and making the platform easy to use.
*   **Party System**: Included to test the social learning hypothesis, which is a key differentiator.

## Included Features (Updated Based on Mentor Feedback)

*   **Enhanced User Roles**: Added Verified Lecturer system to maintain educational quality while keeping complexity low.
*   **Simplified Educator Tools**: Basic guild management and document sharing to support educator use cases without overwhelming complexity.

## Included MVP Features (All Phases 1-4)

**The MVP now includes comprehensive features across all core phases:**

*   **Phase 1**: Core student experience with AI-powered quest generation and skill trees
*   **Phase 2**: Social collaboration features including party system and browser extension
*   **Phase 3**: Educator toolkit with guild management and verified lecturer system
*   **Phase 4**: Advanced social features and browser extension integration

## Future Features (Post-MVP)

**The following advanced features remain for future development:**

*   **Marketplace & Economy**: User-driven marketplace, creator economy, virtual currency, and monetization features.
*   **Enterprise Features**: Advanced analytics, institutional integrations, and comprehensive administrative tools.
*   **Advanced AI Features**: Proactive assistance, predictive analytics, audio/video processing, and AI-powered content curation.

**Rationale**: The expanded MVP scope validates the complete core learning experience including social collaboration, while advanced monetization and enterprise features can be developed based on user feedback and market validation.
