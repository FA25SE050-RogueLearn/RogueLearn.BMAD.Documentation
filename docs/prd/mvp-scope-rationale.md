# Rationale for MVP Scope Decisions

This document provides the rationale behind the features included in and excluded from the RogueLearn MVP.

## Core Loop Focus

The primary goal of the MVP is to validate the core user loop: **Select Curriculum (Route) & Career (Class) -> AI Gap Analysis -> Generate Curriculum & Career Quests -> Complete Integrated Learning Path -> Track Academic & Career Progress**. Therefore, the features selected for the MVP are those that are absolutely essential to support this curriculum-first approach with career enhancement.

*   **Curriculum-Career Onboarding**: Essential Route/Class selection with gap analysis integration
*   **AI-Powered Curriculum Quest Generation**: Core value proposition generating quests from academic curriculum
*   **Career Enhancement Integration**: Roadmap.sh integration for career-specific skill development
*   **Curriculum-Based Character Sheet & Skill Tree**: Gamified progress tracking for both academic and career advancement
*   **Enhanced Arsenal (Note Management)**: Curriculum-focused knowledge organization with optional document enhancement

### **Phase 2: Collaborative Learning**
*   **Curriculum-Based Party System**: Route compatibility with Class diversity for collaborative learning
*   **Browser Extension for Academic Content**: Streamlined extraction from university portals and educational websites
*   **Shared Learning Resources**: Party Stash for curriculum materials and career development resources

### **Phase 3: Educational Oversight**

*   **Integrated Progress Tracking**: Dual advancement system for curriculum completion and career specialization
*   **Real-time Collaboration**: Meeting management and collaborative study sessions

## Key MVP Design Decisions

### **Curriculum-First Approach**
**Rationale**: Academic curriculum provides structured, validated learning paths that ensure educational quality while career integration addresses real-world applicability. This approach reduces complexity while maximizing learning outcomes.

### **Optional Document Upload**
**Rationale**: Documents enhance the experience but are not required for core functionality. The curriculum-based approach provides sufficient structure for quest generation, making document processing a value-add rather than a dependency.

### **Gap Analysis Integration**
**Rationale**: Bridging academic curriculum with career requirements ensures graduates are job-ready. This differentiation addresses the common disconnect between academic learning and industry needs.

### **Route/Class System**
**Rationale**: Clear separation between academic path (Route) and career specialization (Class) provides flexibility while maintaining focus. Students can pursue the same curriculum with different career goals or vice versa.

## Future Features (Post-MVP)

**The following advanced features remain for future development:**

*   **Advanced AI Features**: Proactive learning assistance, predictive analytics, and AI-powered content curation
*   **Enterprise Integration**: LMS integration, institutional analytics, and administrative dashboards
*   **Marketplace & Economy**: User-generated content, creator economy, and monetization features
*   **Advanced Collaboration**: Cross-institutional parties, international study groups, and industry mentorship

**Rationale**: The curriculum-first MVP validates the core educational value proposition and career readiness integration, while advanced features can be developed based on user feedback and institutional partnerships.
