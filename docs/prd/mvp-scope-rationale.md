# Rationale for MVP Scope Decisions

This document provides the rationale behind the features included in and excluded from the RogueLearn MVP.

## Core Loop Focus

The primary goal of the MVP is to validate the core user loop: **Upload Syllabus -> Generate Quest Line -> Complete Quests -> Learn**. Therefore, the features selected for the MVP are those that are absolutely essential to support this loop.

## Included Features

*   **User Onboarding & Document Upload**: Essential for getting users and their data into the system.
*   **AI-Powered Quest Generation**: The core value proposition of the platform.
*   **Character Sheet & Skill Tree**: Provides the gamified progress tracking that is central to the user experience.
*   **Basic Note-Taking ("Arsenal")**: A simple version is needed to support the learning process.
*   **Browser Extension for Data Extraction**: This is a key feature for reducing user friction and making the platform easy to use.
*   **Party System**: Included to test the social learning hypothesis, which is a key differentiator.

## Included Features (Updated Based on Mentor Feedback)

*   **Enhanced User Roles**: Added Verified Lecturer system to maintain educational quality while keeping complexity low.
*   **Simplified Educator Tools**: Basic guild management and document sharing to support educator use cases without overwhelming complexity.

## Excluded Features (Post-MVP)

**Based on mentor feedback, the following have been moved to post-MVP to strengthen focus on core value proposition:**

*   **Advanced Educator Toolkit**: Complex analytics, AI-assisted quest generation, skill tree overlays, and comprehensive administrative tools.
*   **Advanced Social Features (Phase 4)**: Guild-vs-Guild competitions, advanced leaderboards, peer teaching systems, and social learning circles.
*   **Marketplace & Economy (Phase 5)**: User-driven marketplace, creator economy, virtual currency, and monetization features.
*   **Advanced AI Features**: Proactive assistance, predictive analytics, audio/video processing, and AI-powered content curation.

**Rationale for Exclusions**: These features, while valuable, represent 60% of the original scope and could distract from validating the core hypothesis: that gamified learning with RPG mechanics significantly improves student motivation and learning outcomes.
