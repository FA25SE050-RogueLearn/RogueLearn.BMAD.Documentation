# **User Roles and Actors**

This document outlines the key user roles and actors within the RogueLearn ecosystem. The platform's social structure is designed to be intuitive and flexible, mirroring familiar online interactions.

*   **Student (Player):** The primary user of the application. They create a character, pursue a personalized quest line based on their academic and career goals, manage their notes ("Arsenal"), and interact with all the gamified and social elements of the platform.

*   **Party Leader:** A Student who takes on a leadership role within a **"Party"**—a small, private group for focused collaboration, much like a **Messenger or Discord group chat**. Party Leaders can manage membership and organize study sessions.

*   **Guild Master:** Any user—either a Student or a verified Lecturer—can become a Guild Master by creating a **"Guild."** Guilds are larger, public or private communities focused on specific subjects or interests, similar to a **Facebook Group or a Subreddit**. The Guild Master is responsible for managing the Guild, sharing knowledge, and creating **Events** for their members.

*   **Admin (Game Master):** A privileged user responsible for the technical oversight and content management of the RogueLearn platform. They create the foundational content for competitive **Events** (like quiz questions and coding challenge test cases) and oversee the platform's health.

**Special Status: Verified Lecturer**

To signify credibility and expertise, a user can apply to receive a "Verified Lecturer" status through an academic credential validation process. This includes:

**Verification Requirements:**
- University affiliation or teaching position documentation
- Academic credentials (degrees, certifications, teaching qualifications)
- Professional references or institutional endorsement
- Identity verification through secure document upload

**Enhanced Privileges:**
- Special "Verified" badge and credibility indicators
- Streamlined guild creation process with educational templates
- Enhanced guild visibility and discoverability
- Access to basic educator analytics and progress tracking
- Priority support for educational use cases

**Benefits:** Verified Lecturers' guilds become more attractive to students seeking structured, academic-quality learning experiences, while maintaining the platform's focus on gamified learning rather than complex administrative tools.
