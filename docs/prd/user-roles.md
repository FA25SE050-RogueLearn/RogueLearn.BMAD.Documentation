# **User Roles and Actors**

This document outlines the key user roles and actors within the RogueLearn ecosystem.

*   **Tutor (The Guide):** A user assigned by a Lecturer to provide one-on-one assistance to a specific student. They have read-only access to the student's progress for a specific course and can assign non-graded practice drills.

*   **Party Leader:** A student who creates a "Party" (study group). They have the ability to set party rules and invite other students to join.

*   **System Admin (The Game Master):** A privileged user responsible for the technical oversight and maintenance of the RogueLearn platform. They have access to the back-end interface to monitor application health and performance.
