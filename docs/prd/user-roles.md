# **User Roles and Actors**

This document outlines the key user roles and actors within the RogueLearn ecosystem. The platform's curriculum-first social structure is designed to support academic learning with career enhancement, mirroring familiar educational and professional development interactions.

*   **Student (Player):** The primary user of the application. They select a Route (Academic Curriculum) and Class (Career Specialization), complete AI-driven gap analysis, pursue curriculum-based quest lines enhanced with career development content, manage their academic resources ("Arsenal"), and engage with curriculum-compatible collaborative learning features.

*   **Study Group Leader:** A Student who takes on a leadership role within a **"Study Group"** (formerly "Party")—a small, curriculum-compatible group for focused academic collaboration, much like a **study circle or project team**. Study Group Leaders manage Route-compatible membership, organize curriculum-focused study sessions, and facilitate shared learning resource management.

*   **Guild Master:** Any user—either a Student or a verified Lecturer—can become a Guild Master by creating a **"Guild."** Guilds are curriculum-focused communities centered on specific Routes (academic programs) or interdisciplinary learning, similar to a **academic department or professional learning community**. The Guild Master is responsible for curriculum-based guild management, monitoring route-based student progress, and creating curriculum-aligned **Events** for their members.

*   **Admin (Game Master):** A privileged user responsible for the technical oversight and educational content management of the RogueLearn platform. They create curriculum-aligned foundational content for competitive **Events** (like academic assessments and career readiness challenges), manage curriculum-career integration systems, and oversee the platform's educational effectiveness.

**Event Creation Privileges:**
- Create platform-wide events with standard templates (auto-approved)
- Create custom events (subject to peer review)
- Approve/reject Guild Master event requests
- Override event parameters for educational quality assurance
- Access to event analytics and performance monitoring tools

**Special Status: Verified Lecturer**

To signify academic credibility and curriculum expertise, a user can apply to receive a "Verified Lecturer" status through an enhanced academic credential validation process. This includes:

**Verification Requirements:**
- University affiliation or teaching position documentation
- Academic credentials (degrees, certifications, curriculum development experience)
- Professional references or institutional endorsement for curriculum expertise
- Identity verification through secure document upload
- Curriculum development or academic instruction experience

**Enhanced Privileges:**
- Special "Verified Educator" badge and curriculum credibility indicators
- Streamlined guild creation process with curriculum-aligned educational templates
- Enhanced guild visibility for Route-specific academic communities
- Access to curriculum analytics and route-based student progress tracking
- Priority support for curriculum-career integration use cases
- Ability to create curriculum-verified quest content and assessments

**Benefits:** Verified Lecturers' guilds become authoritative sources for Route-specific learning, providing students with curriculum-aligned, academically rigorous learning experiences while maintaining the platform's focus on gamified academic progression with career enhancement.
