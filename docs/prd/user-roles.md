# **User Roles and Actors**

This document outlines the key user roles and actors within the RogueLearn ecosystem. The platform's curriculum-first social structure is designed to support academic learning with career enhancement, mirroring familiar educational and professional development interactions.

*   **Player (Student):** The primary user of the application. They select a Route (Academic Curriculum) and Class (Career Specialization), complete AI-driven gap analysis, pursue curriculum-based quest lines enhanced with career development content, manage their academic resources ("Arsenal"), and engage with curriculum-compatible collaborative learning features.

*   **Party Leader:** A Student who takes on a leadership role within a **"Party"**—a small, curriculum-compatible group for focused academic collaboration, much like a **study circle or project team**. Party Leaders manage Route-compatible membership, organize curriculum-focused study sessions, and facilitate shared learning resource management.

*   **Guild Master:** Any user—either a Student or a verified Lecturer—can become a Guild Master by creating a **"Guild."** Guilds are curriculum-focused communities centered on specific Routes (academic programs) or interdisciplinary learning, similar to a **academic department or professional learning community**. The Guild Master is responsible for curriculum-based guild management, monitoring route-based student progress, and creating curriculum-aligned **Events** for their members.

*   **Game Master (Admin):** A privileged user responsible for the technical oversight and educational content management of the RogueLearn platform. They create curriculum-aligned foundational content for competitive **Events** (like academic assessments and career readiness challenges), manage curriculum-career integration systems, and oversee the platform's educational effectiveness.


**Event Creation Privileges:**
- Create platform-wide events with standard templates (auto-approved)
- Create custom events (subject to peer review)
- Approve/reject Guild Master event requests
- Override event parameters for educational quality assurance
- Access to event analytics and performance monitoring tools

**Special Status: Verified Lecturer**

To signify academic credibility and curriculum expertise, a user can apply to receive a "Verified Lecturer" status through an enhanced academic credential validation process. This includes:

**Verification Requirements:**
- University affiliation or teaching position documentation
- Academic credentials (degrees, certifications, curriculum development experience)
- Professional references or institutional endorsement for curriculum expertise
- Identity verification through secure document upload
- Curriculum development or academic instruction experience

**Enhanced Privileges:**
- Special "Verified Educator" badge and curriculum credibility indicators
- Streamlined guild creation process with curriculum-aligned educational templates
- Enhanced guild visibility for Route-specific academic communities
- Access to curriculum analytics and route-based student progress tracking
- Priority support for curriculum-career integration use cases
- Ability to create curriculum-verified quest content and assessments

**Benefits:** Verified Lecturers' guilds become authoritative sources for Route-specific learning, providing students with curriculum-aligned, academically rigorous learning experiences while maintaining the platform's focus on gamified academic progression with career enhancement.

### **Ownership Update: Elective Library & University Administration**

Per scope decisions, the **Game Master (System Admin)** owns the following flows to ensure platform-wide consistency, quality control, and governance:

- **Elective Library Curation & Approval**
  - Source vetting (faculty-submitted content, trusted repositories, community proposals)
  - Review and approval workflow with audit logging
  - Tagging, versioning, and alignment to skill-tree nodes
  - Publication to the Elective Library after approval
  - Guild Masters and Verified Lecturers can consume approved content; they cannot publish unvetted items

- **University Curriculum Import & Administration**
  - Curriculum import cadence (e.g., per semester) and approved formats (CSV/API)
  - Version management and effective date tracking
  - Schedule/calendar alignment and program/route mapping
  - Reporting and export capabilities for academic oversight

This consolidates administrative responsibilities under the Game Master for quality assurance. Guild Masters and Verified Lecturers retain educational engagement capabilities but do not own these administrative workflows.
