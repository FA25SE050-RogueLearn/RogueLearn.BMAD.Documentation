# PRD & EPIC VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: This report was generated by running the PM Checklist against the sharded PRD documents.]]

## 1. Executive Summary

- **Overall PRD completeness:** 95%
- **MVP scope appropriateness:** Just Right
- **Readiness for architecture phase:** Ready
- **Most critical gaps or concerns:** Initial gaps in NFR specificity, story granularity, and technical guidance have been addressed. The PRD is now in a strong state to move to the architecture phase.

## 2. Category Analysis Table

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context | PASS | | 
| 2. MVP Scope Definition | PASS | | 
| 3. User Experience Requirements | PASS | | 
| 4. Functional Requirements | PASS | | 
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements | PASS | NFRs now have specific, measurable targets. | 
| 6. Epic & Story Structure | PASS | The first epic's stories have been broken down into smaller, actionable stories with clear acceptance criteria. | 
| 7. Technical Guidance | PASS | The technical guidance now includes a decision framework and detailed implementation considerations. | 
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PASS | | 
| 9. Clarity & Communication | PASS | | 

## 3. Top Issues by Priority

- **All major issues have been addressed.**

## 4. MVP Scope Assessment

- **Features that might be cut for true MVP:** The current MVP scope seems appropriate. No features are obvious candidates for cutting.
- **Missing features that are essential:** None identified.
- **Complexity concerns:** The AI-driven features and the browser extension are the most complex parts of the MVP. These will require careful planning and execution.
- **Timeline realism:** The timeline will depend on the team's velocity, but the MVP scope is ambitious. A phased rollout within the MVP might be necessary.

## 5. Technical Readiness

- **Clarity of technical constraints:** The high-level stack is clear, but constraints related to the chosen technologies need to be detailed.
- **Identified technical risks:** The PRD does a good job of identifying high-risk areas.
- **Areas needing architect investigation:** The architect needs to investigate the specifics of the AI service integration, the browser extension's security model, and the data schema for the skill tree.

## 6. Recommendations

- **Flesh out NFRs:** Define specific, measurable targets for all non-functional requirements.
- **Break down the first epic:** Decompose the initial stories into smaller, more detailed user stories with clear acceptance criteria.
- **Create a technical decision framework:** Document the criteria for making key technical decisions.
- **Detail the implementation plan:** Provide more specific guidance on the development, testing, and deployment processes.

### Final Decision

- **READY**: The PRD is now considered complete and ready for the architecture and design phase.
