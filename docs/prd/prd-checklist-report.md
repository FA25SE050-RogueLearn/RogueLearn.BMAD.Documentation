## TOP ISSUES BY PRIORITY

### HIGH PRIORITY
*No high-priority issues identified. The PRD meets all critical requirements for development readiness.*

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
1. **Market Quantification Enhancement**
   - **Issue:** While market opportunity is well-described qualitatively, specific market size data and competitive analysis metrics would strengthen the business case
   - **Impact:** Low - doesn't affect development readiness but could enhance stakeholder buy-in
   - **Recommendation:** Add TAM/SAM/SOM analysis and competitive positioning metrics

2. **Accessibility Standards Documentation**
   - **Issue:** Limited explicit coverage of accessibility requirements (WCAG compliance, assistive technology support)
   - **Impact:** Medium - important for inclusive design and compliance
   - **Recommendation:** Add accessibility requirements section with specific WCAG 2.1 AA compliance targets

### LOW PRIORITY
1. **Edge Case Documentation**
   - **Issue:** Some user stories could benefit from more detailed edge case scenarios
   - **Impact:** Low - core functionality is well-defined
   - **Recommendation:** Expand acceptance criteria for complex user flows during development
