# PRD & EPIC VALIDATION SUMMARY

This report summarizes the completeness and readiness of the QuestLearn Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the PM Checklist.

## Executive Summary

- **Overall PRD Completeness:** 70% (Approximate)
- **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right
- **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Nearly Ready
- **Most Critical Gaps:** The most significant gaps are the lack of specific, measurable KPIs, a defined MVP validation strategy, and details on operational and data requirements. While the product vision is strong, the framework for measuring success and managing the product post-launch is underdeveloped.

## Category Analysis Table

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context | PARTIAL | No quantifiable problem impact, success metrics (KPIs), or timeframes. |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition | PARTIAL | Rationale for scope decisions and MVP validation approach are missing. |
| 3. User Experience Requirements | PARTIAL | No error handling, user feedback mechanisms, or navigation structure defined. |
| 4. Functional Requirements | PASS | Minor gap in defining local testability requirements. |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements | PASS | - |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure | PASS | - |
| 7. Technical Guidance | PARTIAL | No framework for making future technical decisions is documented. |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | FAIL | Data and operational requirements are not detailed. |
| 9. Clarity & Communication | PARTIAL | No stakeholder alignment plan. |

## Top Issues by Priority

### BLOCKERS (Must fix before architect can proceed)

1.  **Data Requirements:** The architect needs a preliminary data model (entities, relationships) to design the database schema and services effectively.
2.  **Operational Requirements:** The architect needs to understand the deployment and monitoring strategy to make appropriate infrastructure choices.

### HIGH (Should fix for quality)

1.  **Success Metrics (KPIs):** The team cannot measure success without clear, measurable goals for the MVP (e.g., target user engagement, retention rate).
2.  **MVP Validation Approach:** A plan for how to test the MVP with users and gather feedback is essential for the learning phase.
3.  **Error Handling & Recovery:** Defining a strategy for handling errors is crucial for a good user experience and system stability.

### MEDIUM (Would improve clarity)

1.  **Rationale for Scope Decisions:** Documenting why features were included/excluded from the MVP improves alignment.
2.  **Stakeholder Alignment:** Identifying stakeholders and a communication plan will prevent future misalignments.

## MVP Scope Assessment

- **Features that might be cut:** The current MVP scope seems appropriate and well-focused on the core user loop. No features stand out as obvious candidates for cutting.
- **Missing features that are essential:** None. The MVP feels complete for its stated goals.
- **Complexity Concerns:** The highest complexity lies in the AI-driven features and the browser extension, as correctly identified in `technical-assumptions.md`.
- **Timeline Realism:** Without a timeline, it's impossible to assess realism.

## Technical Readiness

- **Clarity of technical constraints:** High. The tech stack is clearly defined.
- **Identified technical risks:** High. The high-risk areas are well-documented.
- **Areas needing architect investigation:** The primary areas for investigation are data modeling and designing the AI processing pipeline, which are dependent on the **BLOCKER** issues identified above.

## Recommendations

1.  **Define Data Requirements:** Create a preliminary data model identifying the main entities (`User`, `Course`, `Syllabus`, `Quest`, `Note`, `Party`) and their relationships.
2.  **Outline Operational Requirements:** Specify the expected deployment frequency, environment needs (dev, staging, prod), and a basic monitoring plan (e.g., what key metrics to watch).
3.  **Establish KPIs:** Define 3-5 key performance indicators for the MVP. For example: 
    - Weekly Active Users (WAU)
    - Average number of quests completed per user per week
    - Party creation rate
4.  **Create an MVP Validation Plan:** Document how you will recruit initial users, collect their feedback (e.g., surveys, interviews), and what criteria will determine if the core hypotheses are validated.

### Final Decision

- **NEEDS REFINEMENT:** The PRD is strong in vision and functional detail but requires additional work on the identified deficiencies, particularly in data, operational, and success-measurement requirements, before it is fully ready for the architecture phase.
