# **Technical Guidance**

### **Core Architecture**

-   **Repository Structure:** Multi-Repo (separate repositories for frontend and backend) to ensure separation of concerns and independent deployment pipelines.
-   **Service Architecture:** A decoupled Frontend/Backend model will be used. The frontend will be a Next.js application, and the backend will consist of .NET Core services.
-   **Shared Code Strategy:** A private, versioned NPM package will be created to share TypeScript types and interfaces between the frontend and backend, ensuring consistency.

### **Technical Decision Framework**

All significant technical decisions will be evaluated against the following criteria, in order of priority:

1.  **User Experience & Performance:** Does the choice lead to a fast, responsive, and intuitive user experience?
2.  **Developer Experience & Velocity:** Is the technology easy to work with, well-documented, and does it enable the team to build and iterate quickly?
3.  **Scalability & Cost-Effectiveness:** Can the solution scale to meet projected user growth without incurring prohibitive costs?
4.  **Security & Reliability:** Is the technology secure, stable, and does it have a strong track record?
5.  **Ecosystem & Community:** Is there a strong community and a healthy ecosystem of libraries and tools around the technology?

### **Implementation Considerations**

-   **Testing Strategy:**
    -   **Unit Tests:** All critical business logic in both the frontend and backend will be covered by unit tests (Jest for frontend, xUnit for backend).
    -   **Integration Tests:** Integration tests will be written to verify the interactions between the frontend, backend, and database for key user flows (e.g., onboarding, quest generation).
    -   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** A small suite of E2E tests using a framework like Cypress or Playwright will be created to validate critical user journeys from the user's perspective.
-   **Deployment Strategy:**
    -   A CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions) will be set up to automatically build, test, and deploy the applications to staging and production environments.
    -   The backend services will be containerized using Docker and deployed to a managed service (e.g., Azure App Service, AWS Fargate).
    -   The frontend will be deployed to Vercel to take advantage of its integration with Next.js.

### **High-Risk Areas & Mitigation**

-   **AI-driven Data Processing:**
    -   **Risk:** The complexity of accurately parsing diverse academic documents and generating meaningful quest lines.
    -   **Mitigation:** Start with a well-defined schema for a single type of document (e.g., a specific university's syllabus format). Use a phased approach, gradually adding support for more formats. Leverage a robust third-party AI service (like OpenAI's GPT) and focus on prompt engineering.
-   **Browser Extension:**
    -   **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities and the challenge of reliably scraping data from various university portals.
    -   **Mitigation:** Follow security best practices for browser extensions. Initially, target a single, widely-used university portal and build a specific scraper for it. Use a secure API endpoint for communication between the extension and the backend.
-   **Dynamic Skill Tree:**
    -   **Risk:** The complexity of the logic for mapping knowledge and generating a visually coherent and dynamic graph.
    -   **Mitigation:** Use a graph database or a library designed for graph visualization (e.g., D3.js, Vis.js). Start with a simple, hierarchical structure and add more complex relationships iteratively.
