# **Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

- To launch a viable MVP that demonstrates the core student and collaborative learning loops.
- To create a highly engaging, gamified student experience that increases motivation and reduces exam anxiety by transforming academic milestones into epic "Boss Fights" and learning modules into a visualized, interconnected "Skill Tree."
- To provide a browser extension that seamlessly integrates with the student's digital environment, automatically capturing and organizing learning materials from across the web into a personal "Arsenal."
- To establish a clear, AI-driven learning path for students that aligns their current educational route (e.g., university syllabus) with their long-term career aspirations (e.g., becoming a Full-Stack Developer).
- To empower students to personalize their learning journey by uploading academic data such as GPA, transcripts, and schedules, which will dynamically influence their in-game stats, skill tree, and quest line.
- To allow students to define their career goals ("Class") and current learning path ("Route") to generate a personalized main quest line.
- To enable peer-to-peer collaborative study through an intuitive "Party" system.
- To validate a multi-tiered subscription model for future monetization.

### **Background Context**

University students often face significant challenges with motivation and connecting their current studies to future career goals. The lack of a clear, engaging pathway can lead to procrastination and anxiety. QuestLearn addresses this by transforming the educational journey into an interactive RPG. It allows students to choose a "Class" (their desired profession) and a "Route" (their current academic program), and further personalize their experience by uploading academic data like GPA, transcripts, and schedules. The system then provides a structured, AI-powered "main quest line" where exams become "Boss Fights," and knowledge acquisition is visualized as a "Skill Tree." This shows students exactly how their learning connects and contributes to their ultimate goal. A companion browser extension further enhances this by automatically capturing relevant learning materials from the web, organizing them into the student's "Arsenal." This turns passive learning into an active and meaningful adventure, making studying more effective and building a foundation for a rich academic ecosystem involving lecturers, tutors, and peer groups.
