# **User Interface Design Goals**

The visual theme will evoke a "Magical Scribe" or "Adventurer's Journal" aesthetic while maintaining a clean, modern, and readable UI. The application will be a responsive web app, designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

- **Character Creation Screen:** This screen must allow users to select their "Class" (career goal) and "Route" (academic path). It should also provide a secure and intuitive interface for uploading academic documents (transcripts, schedules). The design should be clean, with clear instructions and feedback on the upload process.
- **Skill Tree Visualization:** The interface must include a visually engaging and interactive skill tree. This will display acquired knowledge, show connections between skills, and clearly illustrate the path toward the user's career goals, including highlighting any knowledge gaps.
- **Boss Fight/Event Screen:** This screen will present exams and tests as "Boss Fights." It must clearly display the event's description, the knowledge and skills required to "win," and the user's current readiness.
- **Browser Extension UI:** The extension's pop-up (triggered on text highlight) must be unobtrusive and provide a quick, readable view of relevant notes from the user's "Arsenal."
- **Party Management Screen:** This interface must provide clear options for creating and managing a party. It should include an intuitive system for setting party rules, inviting friends, and a browse/search feature to find and invite other players, displaying key stats to help with selection.
- **Leaderboard Display:** The UI must present a clear and motivating leaderboard, with filters for viewing rankings by class and overall.
- **Arsenal/Notes Editor:** The notes editor must be a clean, intuitive, Notion-like interface that supports rich text formatting, embedding, and organization.
- **Skill Tree Interaction:** When a user interacts with a skill node on the tree, the interface should seamlessly display links to related notes in their Arsenal.
- **Guild Management Interface:** A dedicated interface for lecturers to create and manage guilds, upload documents, and communicate with student members. Students will need an interface to join guilds and access these materials.
- **Notification Center:** A clear and accessible notification system to alert users to dynamic changes in their questline and other important updates.
