## 3.2 Onboarding & Academic Data

### 3.2.1 Character Creation Flow
> A function can be a screen or a non-screen function. Provide: trigger, description, layout, and details.

- Function trigger: Navigates via Login â†’ Onboarding; may be re-entered from Profile settings.
- Function description: Student selects Curriculum, Specialization (roadmap.sh), and generates Skill-based Roadmap; optionally uploads academic documents to adjust stats and verification.
- Screen layout: Three steps with progress indicator; document upload pop-up; summary confirmation.
- Function details: 
  - Validation: Required selection per step; file type checks (PDF, PNG/JPG); max 10MB per file.
  - Business rules: Curriculum-first quest generation; verified FPTU status unlocks university-specific flows.
  - Normal cases: Successful selections generate default quest line; uploaded docs adjust stats immediately.
  - Abnormal cases: Upload failures show retry and error messaging; incomplete steps prevent progression.

## 3.3 AI Curriculum & Career Alignment

- Function trigger: After onboarding step completion or when changing specialization.
- Function description: AI analyzes curriculum vs roadmap.sh to identify gaps and generate supplementary quests.
- Function details: Confidence thresholds; quarterly refresh; integrates into semester schedule respecting load.
