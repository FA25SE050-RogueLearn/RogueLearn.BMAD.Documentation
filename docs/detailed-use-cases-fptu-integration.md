# FPTU-Specific Use Case Integration

This document outlines how FPTU-specific requirements (FR48-FR51) are integrated across the existing use cases to ensure comprehensive coverage of university-specific functionality.

## FPTU Requirements Coverage Analysis

### FR48: FPTU Student Verification System
**Requirement:** The system must implement FPTU student verification through academic document analysis and university portal integration to validate student status and academic standing.

**Coverage in Use Cases:**
- **UC-001 (User Registration):** Added FR48 to ensure student verification during onboarding
- **UC-002 (Document Enhancement):** Added FR48 to validate academic documents during upload
- **Recommended Enhancement:** Add verification step in UC-001 main scenario step 8A: "System validates FPTU student status through document analysis and portal integration"

### FR49: Quest Memory & Continuity System
**Requirement:** The system must implement quest memory and history tracking to maintain continuity across semesters and academic periods.

**Coverage in Use Cases:**
- **UC-001 (User Registration):** Added FR49 to establish quest memory during initial setup
- **UC-004 (Quest Generation):** Added FR49 to ensure continuity in quest generation
- **Recommended Enhancement:** Add to UC-004 alternative flow: "A4: Semester transition - System leverages quest memory to maintain continuity across academic periods"

### FR50: FPTU Portal Integration (Browser Extension)
**Requirement:** The browser extension must implement comprehensive FPTU portal integration for automated academic data extraction and quest synchronization.

**Coverage in Use Cases:**
- **UC-007 (Browser Extension):** Added FR50 to cover FPTU portal integration
- **Recommended Enhancement:** Add FPTU-specific scenario in UC-007: "A4: FPTU Portal Integration - Extension automatically extracts academic schedules, grades, and course materials from FPTU portal"

### FR51: Adaptive Quest Generation for Failed Students
**Requirement:** The system must implement adaptive quest generation for students who fail semesters, providing specialized recovery and remediation pathways.

**Coverage in Use Cases:**
- **UC-004 (Quest Generation):** Added FR51 to cover adaptive generation for failed students
- **Recommended Enhancement:** Add to UC-004 alternative flow: "A5: Failed Course Recovery - System generates specialized remediation quests based on failed course analysis and academic standing"

## Integration Recommendations

### New Use Case Suggestion: UC-016 FPTU Academic Integration
Consider adding a dedicated use case for comprehensive FPTU integration:

**Use Case Name:** FPTU Academic System Integration and Monitoring
**Description:** System maintains real-time synchronization with FPTU academic systems, monitors student progress, and provides specialized support for FPTU-specific academic workflows.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time grade synchronization
- Automatic failed course detection
- Semester transition management
- Academic calendar integration
- Specialized quest generation for FPTU curriculum

### Enhanced Scenario Integration

1. **UC-001 Enhancement:** Add FPTU verification step
2. **UC-004 Enhancement:** Add semester continuity and failed student pathways
3. **UC-007 Enhancement:** Add FPTU portal-specific extraction capabilities

## Compliance Verification

All FPTU-specific requirements (FR48-FR51) are now properly referenced in the relevant use cases, ensuring:
- ✅ Student verification is covered in registration and document processes
- ✅ Quest memory continuity is maintained across academic periods
- ✅ FPTU portal integration is included in browser extension functionality
- ✅ Adaptive quest generation for failed students is properly addressed

This integration ensures the RogueLearn platform fully supports FPTU-specific academic workflows while maintaining compatibility with general educational use cases.
