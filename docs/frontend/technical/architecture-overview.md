# Technical Architecture Overview

## Repository Structure

Multi-repo approach with separate repositories for frontend and backend to ensure separation of concerns and independent deployment pipelines.

## Frontend Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance
- **State Management:** React Context API for simple state, Redux for complex global state
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom theme extensions for the RPG aesthetic
- **Animation:** Framer Motion for complex animations, CSS transitions for simple ones
- **Data Fetching:** React Query for server state management and caching

## Shared Code Strategy

A private, versioned NPM package will be used to share TypeScript types and interfaces between the frontend and backend, ensuring consistency in data structures.

## Development Approach

### Component Architecture

- Atomic design methodology (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
- Storybook for component documentation and visual testing
- Strict typing with TypeScript for all components and utilities

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all UI components and utilities using Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration tests for key user flows and component interactions
- End-to-End tests using Cypress or Playwright for critical user journeys
- Visual regression testing with Chromatic or similar tool

### Accessibility Testing

- Automated testing with axe-core or similar tools
- Manual testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Regular audits using Lighthouse

## Deployment & CI/CD

### Deployment Platform

Vercel for seamless integration with Next.js

### CI/CD Pipeline

- GitHub Actions for automated build, test, and deployment
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Automated accessibility and performance checks

## Performance Optimization

### Core Web Vitals Targets

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1

### Optimization Techniques

- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components
- Server-side rendering for initial page load
- Static generation for content that doesn't change frequently
- Edge caching for API responses

## High-Risk Areas & Mitigation

### Dynamic Skill Tree Visualization

- **Risk:** Complex graph visualization with many nodes and relationships
- **Mitigation:** Use specialized libraries like D3.js or Vis.js, implement progressive loading, and optimize rendering with virtualization

### Browser Extension Integration

- **Risk:** Security concerns and cross-browser compatibility
- **Mitigation:** Follow security best practices, implement robust error handling, and focus on Chrome first with gradual expansion to other browsers

### Real-time Collaboration

- **Risk:** Synchronization issues and performance degradation
- **Mitigation:** Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events efficiently, implement conflict resolution strategies, and add fallback mechanisms for offline scenarios
