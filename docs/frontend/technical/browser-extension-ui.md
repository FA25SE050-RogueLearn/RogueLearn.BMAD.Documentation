```

## Visual Design

### Color Palette

- Follows main application palette with slightly muted tones for browser context
- Background uses a semi-transparent dark theme to work across various websites

### Typography

- Uses system fonts for optimal performance
- Size hierarchy:
  - Headers: 16px
  - Body: 14px
  - Labels: 12px

### Iconography

- Consistent with main application
- Optimized for small display areas
- High contrast for visibility

## Interaction Design

### Animations

- Subtle entrance/exit animations for popup (150ms duration)
- Success animations for completed actions (300ms duration)
- Pulsing effects for notifications (infinite loop with 2s cycle)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Alt+R:** Open extension popup
- **Alt+N:** Quick note capture
- **Alt+H:** Highlight text and save
- **Esc:** Close popup

## Technical Considerations

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (primary support)
- Firefox
- Edge

### Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading of popup content
- Throttled content analysis
- Local storage for frequently accessed data

### Security Considerations

- Content script isolation
- Secure authentication with main application
- Data encryption for sensitive information

## Error Handling

### Common Error States

- **Authentication Failure:** Prompt user to log in to main application
- **Connection Loss:** Queue actions for sync when connection restored
- **Permission Denied:** Guide user to grant necessary permissions

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Features | Timeline |
|-------|----------|----------|
| MVP | Basic toolbar, popup, highlighting | 2 weeks |
| Phase 2 | Skill detection, quest integration | 3 weeks |
| Phase 3 | Advanced features, performance optimization | 2 weeks |

## Testing Plan

- **Unit Testing:** Component-level tests for all UI elements
- **Integration Testing:** End-to-end flows across different websites
- **User Testing:** 5-7 students using think-aloud protocol
- **Performance Testing:** Load time and memory usage benchmarks
