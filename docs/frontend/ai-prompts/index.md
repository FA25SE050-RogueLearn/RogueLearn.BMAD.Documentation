## How to Use These Prompts

### Best Practices

1. **Start with the basics**: Generate the core components and theme first
2. **Iterate gradually**: Don't expect to generate the entire application at once
3. **Review and refine**: Carefully review all generated code and make necessary adjustments
4. **Focus on one section**: For best results, focus the AI on specific sections rather than the entire application

### Workflow

1. Choose the appropriate prompt based on what you want to generate
2. Copy the entire prompt content
3. Paste it into your AI frontend generation tool
4. Review the generated code and make necessary adjustments
5. Integrate the code into your project

### Customization

Feel free to modify these prompts to better suit your specific needs. You can adjust:

- Visual styling details
- Component behavior
- Technical implementation details
- Scope and complexity

### Important Note

All AI-generated code will require careful human review, testing, and refinement to be considered production-ready. These prompts are starting points to accelerate your development process, not replacements for thoughtful engineering.
