# 3. Target Audience

### **Primary Target Audience (MVP Focus)**

The primary target audience for the initial release of RogueLearn is **FPT University students currently enrolled in the Software Engineering major**.

*   **Rationale:** This group is the ideal "beachhead market" for validation. Their curriculum is well-structured, providing a predictable and high-quality data source for our core AI quest generation feature. Their clear, career-oriented academic path makes them the perfect user base to test, validate, and refine our primary value proposition of enhancing employability.

### **Secondary Target Audience (Post-MVP Expansion)**

Following a successful MVP launch and validation with the primary group, the platform will be expanded to support:

1.  Students in other IT-related majors at FPT University (e.g., Information Security, Artificial Intelligence).
2.  Software engineering and computer science students at other universities.
