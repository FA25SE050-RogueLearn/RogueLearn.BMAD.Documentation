# 2. Business Objectives

1.  **Enhance Student Employability:** The primary objective is to provide students with a clear, demonstrable path from their academic studies to career readiness. The platform must successfully bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and the practical skills, portfolio projects, and interview preparation required by the job market.

2.  **Increase Student Engagement and Motivation:** To combat academic disengagement, the platform must transform the learning process into a compelling, gamified experience. Success is measured by sustained user activity, consistent progress through the "Main Quest," and positive qualitative feedback on motivation.

3.  **Create a Personalized and Adaptive Learning Pathway:** The system must intelligently process a student's official curriculum (e.g., FPT University's) and integrate it with industry-standard roadmaps (e.g., roadmap.sh) to generate a personalized and relevant "Main Quest Line." This pathway must adapt to a student's specialization choices and elective learning.

4.  **Validate the Gamified Career-Readiness Model:** As a capstone project, a key objective is to validate the core hypothesis: that a gamified, career-focused approach leads to better learning outcomes and higher engagement than traditional study methods. This will be measured through user feedback and engagement analytics.
