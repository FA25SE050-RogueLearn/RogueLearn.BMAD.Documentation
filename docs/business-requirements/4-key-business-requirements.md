# 4. Key Business Requirements

To achieve its objectives, the RogueLearn platform must fulfill the following core business requirements:

1.  **Provide a Career-Focused Onboarding Experience:** The platform must guide new users through a "Character Creation" process where they select a specific, curated career path (e.g., ".NET Developer") which defines their "Main Quest."

2.  **Generate a Unified, Goal-Oriented Learning Path:** The system must be able to ingest a student's academic documents (e.g., FPT curriculum) and intelligently merge them with industry-standard roadmaps (e.g., roadmap.sh) to produce a single, unified "Main Quest Line" that is explicitly tied to the user's selected career goal.

3.  **Support Academic Specializations as Core Quest Chapters:** The system must seamlessly integrate senior-year specialization choices (e.g., .NET, React) as advanced, mandatory chapters of the user's Main Quest.

4.  **Offer a Library of Career-Enhancing Electives:** To provide flexibility, the platform must offer a curated library of "Elective Skill Arcs" that allow students to learn valuable skills outside their core track.

5.  **Deliver Tangible Career Preparation Outcomes:** The system must include a dedicated "Career Preparations" epic. This module must contain:
    *   **Project Quests** that guide students in building portfolio-worthy projects on their public GitHub.
    *   **Algorithmic Challenges (Code Battles)** that build a quantifiable, LeetCode-style profile for technical interviews.
    *   Quests focused on resume refinement and professional networking.

6.  **Facilitate Collaborative Learning:** The platform must support social and collaborative learning through small-group "Parties" that enable students to study together and share resources.

7.  **Implement Core Gamification Mechanics:** The system must include foundational gamification elements—including Experience Points (XP), Levels, Skill Trees, and Achievements—to drive student motivation.
