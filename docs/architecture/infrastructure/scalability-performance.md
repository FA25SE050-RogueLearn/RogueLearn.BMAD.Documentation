# Scalability and Performance

## Scalability Strategy

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Stateless services for easy replication
   - Load balancing across multiple instances
   - Auto-scaling based on demand

2. **Database Scaling**
   - Read replicas for query-heavy operations
   - Sharding strategy for future growth
   - Caching layer for frequently accessed data

3. **Content Delivery**
   - CDN for static assets and content
   - Edge caching for global performance
   - Image and media optimization

## Performance Optimization

1. **Frontend Performance**
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - Server-side rendering for initial load
   - Progressive Web App capabilities
   - Optimized bundle size

2. **API Performance**
   - Response compression
   - Efficient pagination and filtering
   - Query optimization
   - Batch operations for multiple resources

3. **Database Performance**
   - Indexing strategy for common queries
   - Query optimization and monitoring
   - Regular performance tuning
