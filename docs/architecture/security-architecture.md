# Security Architecture

## Authentication and Authorization

1. **Authentication Mechanism**
   - Azure Active Directory B2C for identity management
   - JWT-based authentication for API access
   - OAuth 2.0 for third-party integrations
   - Refresh token rotation for enhanced security

2. **Authorization Model**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Resource-based permissions
   - Context-aware authorization (e.g., party leader permissions)

3. **Browser Extension Security**
   - Secure storage of credentials
   - Content script isolation
   - CORS and CSP compliance
   - Limited permission scope

## Data Protection

1. **Data at Rest**
   - Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for SQL Database
   - Encrypted storage for sensitive user data
   - Secure key management with Azure Key Vault

2. **Data in Transit**
   - TLS 1.3 for all communications
   - Certificate pinning for API endpoints
   - Secure WebSocket connections for real-time features

3. **Privacy Considerations**
   - Data minimization principles
   - Clear user consent for data collection
   - Data retention policies
   - GDPR and CCPA compliance
