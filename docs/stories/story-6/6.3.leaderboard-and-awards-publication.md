# Story 6.3: Code Battle â€” Leaderboard and Awards Publication

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a System/Admin, I want to finalize rankings, publish the leaderboard, and process awards, so that participants can see transparent results and prizes are distributed.

Reference: docs/stories/FA25_CP_grp4_RogueLearn_Review2-solution.md (Flow 3: Competition Process Step 6; Event Dashboards and Metrics)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Leaderboard aggregates final scores per room and overall; ties resolved per configured rules.
2. Results publication notifies participants and guilds; public pages show rankings.
3. Awards processing records prize entries and supports payout status tracking.
4. Dashboard shows score distribution and average time per problem.
5. Historical leaderboards are archived and retrievable.
