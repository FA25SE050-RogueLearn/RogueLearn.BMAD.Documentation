# Story 7.3: Study Party — Meeting Summaries and Party Dashboard

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a System, I want to generate meeting summaries and render a party dashboard with engagement and outcomes, so that members can track effectiveness and action items.

Reference: docs/stories/FA25_CP_grp4_RogueLearn_Review2-solution.md (Flow 4 Steps 7–8; Party Dashboard Widgets)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System captures live notes or post-meeting notes and produces a summary document with action items.
2. Party dashboard shows attendance rate, meeting frequency, shared materials count, topic coverage, action items completed, and study time per member.
3. Members can tag materials and link them to topics; versioning retained.
4. Summary documents are stored and shareable within the party space.
5. Dashboard updates within minutes of meeting end and materials changes.

## Tasks / Subtasks
