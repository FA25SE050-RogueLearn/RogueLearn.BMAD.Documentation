# Story 7.1: Multiplayer Boss Fight — Session Management

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a Student, I want to invite a friend to a multiplayer Boss Fight aligned to FE exam topics, so that we can reinforce knowledge collaboratively and have our results updated in RogueLearn.

Reference: docs/stories/FA25_CP_grp4_RogueLearn_Review2-solution.md (Flow 1 Step 7)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Students can initiate a multiplayer session and invite friends (party members) with simple role assignment.
2. System spins up a multiplayer session on demand and tracks both players’ progress and match stats.
3. After completion, gameplay results are posted back to RogueLearn, updating both students’ profiles and dashboards.
4. Session supports reconnects and gracefully handles disconnects.
5. Notifications are sent for invites, session start, and result summaries.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Backend: Session service for multiplayer Boss Fight; party invite endpoints.
- [ ] Backend: Result sync to user_quest_progress and user_skill_rewards.
- [ ] Frontend: Multiplayer UI flows (invite, accept, start, match summary).
- [ ] Frontend: Error handling for disconnect/reconnect scenarios.
- [ ] QA: Integration tests of session lifecycle; result sync double-checks.

## Dev Notes

- Entity References: party sessions (reuse guild/party structures), user_quest_progress, user_skill_rewards, notifications.
- Matching: Optionally reuse party policies/matchmaking from Story 4.6.
- Telemetry: Capture match stats to support analytics.
