# **Story 1.3: User Registration Flow**

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** prospective player,
**I want** to create an account with email verification,
**so that** I can access the RogueLearn platform securely.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The registration form must validate email format and password strength (min. 8 characters, including mixed case and numbers).
2. The system must require email verification before a new account is fully activated.
3. The system must prevent registration with an email address that is already in use and display a clear, user-friendly error message.
4. The user must be required to accept the User Agreement and Privacy Policy before completing registration.
5. A successful registration must trigger a welcome email to the user, containing instructions for email verification.
6. All registration attempts (both successful and failed) must be logged for security monitoring purposes.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create Registration UI Component** (AC: #1, #4)
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Client-Side Registration Logic** (AC: #2, #3, #5)
- [x] **Task 3: Configure Welcome Email and Verification** (AC: #2, #5)
- [x] **Task 4: Implement Server-Side Logging** (AC: #6)
- [x] **Task 5: Write Tests**

## Dev Notes

### **Relevant Architecture & Business Rules**
*   **Authentication Provider**: All authentication logic MUST be handled via the Supabase Auth client SDK. Do not send user credentials to our backend. The backend's role is only to validate the JWT that Supabase provides after a successful login. [Source: `docs/fullstack-architecture/high-level-architecture.md`]
*   **User Synchronization**: A new user signing up via Supabase will automatically trigger the `handle_new_user` PostgreSQL function created in Story 1.2. This function is responsible for creating a corresponding entry in our public `user_profiles` table. This story must ensure the client-side sign-up passes the necessary metadata (`username`, `first_name`, `last_name`) for that trigger to work correctly. [Source: `docs/stories/1.2.authentication-service-integration.md`]
*   **UI Components**: All UI elements MUST be built using the pre-configured **Shadcn/UI** library to maintain design consistency. [Source: `docs/front-end-spec.md`]
*   **Error Handling**: User-facing error messages should be clear and helpful, abstracting away technical details. For example, instead of "unique constraint violation," display "An account with this email already exists." [Source: `docs/prd/error-handling.md`]
*   **Relevant Files**:
    *   `roguelearn-web/src/app/signup/page.tsx` (to be created)
    *   Supabase Dashboard: Auth > Email Templates
    *   `roguelearn-api/UserService/` (for reviewing logging related to the DB trigger)

## QA Results

### Review Date: [Current Date]
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation is of high quality. The final architecture using a pure database trigger for user synchronization is robust and decoupled. The frontend implementation correctly uses modern Next.js 15 and `@supabase/ssr` patterns for secure, server-side route protection.

### Refactoring Performed
No refactoring was necessary. The developer agent, with user guidance, corrected an initial architectural flaw before final implementation, resulting in a clean and efficient solution.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✓] (Excellent E2E coverage)
- All ACs Met: [✓]

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] **Architectural Soundness:** The final pattern is excellent.
- [ ] **Future Consideration:** For future stories, consider adding more granular component-level unit tests with React Testing Library, even when E2E tests exist, to speed up the test-feedback loop during development.
- [ ] **Process Note for Dev:** Please ensure the "File List" in the Dev Agent Record is filled out upon story completion in the future.

### Security Review
No security issues found. The use of Supabase for authentication offloads significant risk, and the backend JWT validation is implemented correctly.

### Performance Considerations
No performance issues noted. The chosen patterns are efficient.

### Final Status
[✓] **Approved - Story is Done**
