# Story 5.3: Academic Insights Dashboard

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a Student, I want a dashboard that visualizes my GPA trends and highlights failed/at-risk courses, so that I can focus my efforts on improving outcomes.

Reference: docs/stories/FA25_CP_grp4_RogueLearn_Review2-solution.md (Flow 1 Step 3; Metrics and Dashboard Widgets)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dashboard displays GPA trendlines over time from ingested FAP data.
2. Failed and at-risk courses are highlighted with tags and severity indicators.
3. Widgets include suggested actions taken vs outcomes and gameplay-on-topic metrics (if available).
4. Data refresh after new crawl or gameplay events updates the dashboard within 1 minute.
5. Accessibility: charts meet color contrast and keyboard navigation requirements.
6. Backend aggregation endpoints exist to compute KPIs for the dashboard.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Backend: Create analytics endpoints aggregating GPA trends, failed/at-risk courses, suggestion outcomes.
- [ ] Frontend: Build responsive dashboard UI with charts and widgets.
- [ ] Frontend: Implement real-time or near-real-time refresh via subscriptions or polling.
- [ ] Backend: Cache layers for KPI queries to avoid heavy recomputation.
- [ ] QA: Visual accessibility checks; KPI correctness tests; performance benchmarks.

## Dev Notes

- Metrics & Widgets: GPA trends; failed/at-risk counts; actions vs outcomes; gameplay completion rates.
- Entity References: quest_analytics, user_quest_progress, user_skills, notifications.
- Performance: consider pre-aggregations and scheduled jobs to update analytics.
