# Story 5.2: FLM Syllabus Import and Versioning

## Status

Draft

## Story

As an Admin, I want to import course syllabi from FLM and maintain versioned content, so that RogueLearn can map game content to syllabus topics and generate accurate suggestions.

Reference: docs/stories/FA25_CP_grp4_RogueLearn_Review2-solution.md (Flow 1 Preconditions; Key Data Fields; Errors and Edge Cases)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Admins can upload syllabus content via CSV/JSON/Markdown formats.
2. The system validates and stores syllabus content with versioning (syllabus_versions table) linked to subjects.
3. Imports support rollback and re-import with proper audit logs.
4. Missing syllabus content triggers limited suggestions and prompts Admin to upload (UI and notifications).
5. Version selection is configurable per subject and defaulted to latest active version.
6. Data is accessible to suggestion engine and quest mapping.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Backend: Implement FLM import endpoints with format detection and validation.
- [ ] Backend: Persist syllabus to subjects and syllabus_versions; add audit logs.
- [ ] Backend: Admin selection of active syllabus version per subject.
- [ ] Frontend: Admin UI for upload/import, validation feedback, and version management.
- [ ] Frontend: Notify system/users when syllabus is missing or updated.
- [ ] QA: End-to-end tests for import formats, versioning, rollback, and notifications.

## Dev Notes

- Backend Entities: subjects, syllabus_versions; optional linkage to quests for mapping.
- Error/Edge Cases: Missing FLM syllabus -> show limited suggestions; prompt Admin via notifications.
- Versioning Strategy: Use semantic or incremental version numbers; store content as structured JSON/Markdown.
