# Story 5.1: FAP Integration and Crawl Pipeline

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a Student, I want RogueLearn to securely connect to my FAP account and crawl my academic data, so that the system can generate personalized insights and learning suggestions.

Reference: docs/stories/FA25_CP_grp4_RogueLearn_Review2-solution.md (Flow 1, Steps 1–2; Errors and Edge Cases)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Students can connect their FAP account via a secure OAuth/token-based flow; raw passwords are never stored.
2. The system can trigger a "Crawl" job to ingest academic records (Student ID, GPA, course grades, course list) from FAP.
3. Crawl jobs respect FAP rate limits via throttling and queuing; long-running jobs notify the student upon completion.
4. Data ingestion persists normalized records into backend tables (e.g., user_profiles, subjects) per the merged-backend-database.
5. Error handling implements retry with exponential backoff and dead-letter logging for failures.
6. Audit logs record integration actions with who/when/what.
7. Notifications are sent for success/failure states using the notifications table.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Backend: Implement FAP connector service with secure credential storage (token-based) and ingest pipeline.
- [ ] Backend: Add job queue and throttling (e.g., Hangfire/Quartz or cloud queue) to schedule and retry crawl jobs.
- [ ] Backend: Map FAP payloads to internal schema (user_profiles, subjects, curriculum_structure) and persist.
- [ ] Backend: Implement audit logging and notification triggers for crawl results.
- [ ] Frontend: Add UI to connect FAP, display connection status, and trigger Crawl.
- [ ] Frontend: Show crawl progress and completion notifications.
- [ ] QA: Integration tests covering secure auth, rate limits, retries, and persistence correctness.

## Dev Notes

- Flow Mapping: Review2 Flow 1, Steps 1–2; Edge cases include invalid credentials, throttling, and queueing.
- Backend Entities: user_profiles, subjects, curriculum_structure, notifications.
- Security & Compliance: Use secrets manager; avoid storing raw passwords. Tokenize sensitive fields. Logs must not contain PII.
