# Story 3.3: Scaffold Frontend for Event Creation and Approval

## Status

In Progress

## Story

**As a** Game Master (Admin),
**I want** to see and interact with the user interface for creating new events and viewing pending approvals,
**so that** I can provide early feedback on the user experience and the team can prepare for backend integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new set of pages for event management is created in the Next.js application (e.g., under `/admin/events`).
2.  A multi-step form for creating a new event is built, based on the `Event Creation Wizard` wireframes. The form does not need to actually submit to the backend; it can log the data to the console for now.
3.  A page is created to display a list of pending events, based on the `Event Approval Dashboard` wireframe.
4.  All UI components are built using the project's standard library (Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS).
5.  The data for the pending events list is sourced from a **local mock JSON file**. This data should match the API contract being developed by the backend team in Story 3.1.
6.  The components have basic unit tests to ensure they render correctly with mock data.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Set up Routing and Page Structure** (AC: #1)
    - [ ] Create the necessary page files in the `src/app/admin/events/` directory (e.g., `create/page.tsx`, `pending/page.tsx`).
    - [ ] Add navigation links in the admin sidebar to access these new pages.
- [ ] **Task 2: Build the Event Creation Wizard UI** (AC: #2, #4)
    - [ ] Create the React components for each step of the wizard as seen in the wireframes (Basic Info, Schedule, Rules, Review).
    - [ ] Use `React Hook Form` and `Zod` for client-side validation.
    - [ ] On final "submit," the component should simply `console.log` the collected form data.
- [ ] **Task 3: Create Mock Data** (AC: #5)
    - [ ] Create a file (e.g., `src/mocks/pending-events.json`) that contains an array of mock event objects.
    - [ ] The structure of these objects must match the expected response from the `GET /api/admin/events/pending` endpoint being built by the backend team.
- [ ] **Task 4: Build the Pending Approvals Dashboard UI** (AC: #3, #4, #5)
    - [ ] Create the React component to display the list of pending events.
    - [ ] The component will fetch and display the data from the local mock JSON file.
    - [ ] Implement the layout from the wireframe, showing key details for each pending event.
- [ ] **Task 5: Write Component Tests** (AC: #6)
    - [ ] Write basic Jest/React Testing Library tests for the new components to ensure they render correctly when given mock data.
